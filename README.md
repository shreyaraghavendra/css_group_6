## Cellular Automata to Model Cancer Tumour Growth

### Background and motivation of the project

### What disciplines do I use, e.g. statistical physics, biology etc.

### What is the problem that I am addressing?

### Research question(s)?
Clearly state testable hypotheses or questions.
Make them as concrete and precise as possible (probably becomes more precise as time progresses)

### Which model will we implement and simulate? (E.g., a network model, a cellular automaton, an ABM, …)

### Which emergent phenomenon are we focusing on?
Phase transition, synchronization, resilience, SOC, …
How will you measure/detect it from your model?
